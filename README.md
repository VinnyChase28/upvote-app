Breaking down the requirements and creating an implementation plan

## Ticket CS-1

1. Project Setup and Initial Commit

    Task: Initialize the project with Create React App using TypeScript. Add readme.

2. Create Reusable Components Directory

    Task: Set up a structured folder within src for the components, typically named components.

## Ticket CS-2

3. Implement the Upvote Component

    Task: Develop the Upvote component with TypeScript, ensuring it has default and selected states, which are visually distinguishable by background and arrow colors. The component should accept props for its state and a toggle function.

## Ticket CS-3

4. Implement State Management for the Upvote Component

    Task: Integrate state management within the Upvote component to handle its selected/not-selected state. This will likely involve using React's useState hook.

## Ticket CS-4

5. Create the Upvotes List Component

    Task: Develop the UpvotesList component, which uses multiple Upvote components and manages their state collectively. This component should allow adding new Upvote components to the list.

## Ticket CS-5

6. Implement Global State Management (if necessary)

    Task: If the application requires multiple UpvotesList components to interact or share state, set up a context or another state management solution.

## Ticket CS-6
7. Integrate Persistence Mechanism

    Task: Implement functionality to persist the state of the upvotes in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that the state is restored when the page is refreshed.

## Ticket CS-7
8. Writing Tests

    Task: Write tests for the Upvote and UpvotesList components, focusing on interaction (like clicking to toggle state) and rendering based on props.

## Ticket CS-8
9. Final Testing and Cleanup

    Task: Perform final testing on the entire application, check for and fix any bugs, and clean up the code (e.g., removing console logs, improving code readability).

## Ticket CS-9

10. Build and Deployment Preparation

    Task: Prepare the application for deployment by running the build script and performing any necessary pre-deployment steps.
    Commit Point: After successfully building the project and before deploying, to mark the completion of development.
